Stock Tracker Dashboard is a beginner-friendly Python project that fetches historical price data for a handful of major stocks (e.g. AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, JPM) 
using the Yahoo Finance API. 
It demonstrates core data-science skills—data acquisition with yfinance, cleaning and exploration with pandas, and visualizations 
via matplotlib—and implements a simple moving-average crossover strategy to highlight basic buy/sell signals. 
All code runs in a Jupyter Notebook, with clear markdown explanations of each step, making it easy to follow and extend.
